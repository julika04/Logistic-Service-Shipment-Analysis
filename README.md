# Logistic-Service-Shipment-Analysis
# Problem statement:
Road haulage is essential for the people and businesses of the UK. Approximately 90% of all goods 
transported by land in Great Britain are moved directly by road. DigiHaul is a digital transport 
business, specialising in managing, consolidating and integrating data from both Carriers and 
Shippers to deliver seamless end-to-end logistics service. Shippers book shipments on the DigiHaul platform, detailing the scheduled collection and delivery 
time windows / locations and required vehicle types for carriers to consider. Once a carrier accepts a 
job and collection is scheduled, DigiHaul’s driver app facilitates real-time tracking of shipments 
through GPS signals, subject to carriers granting permissions for location logging.
